# SSTRANGE
**SSTRANGE** \(Scalable Similarity TRacker in Academia with Natural lanGuage Explanation\) is a scalable and efficient tool to observe similarities among submissions with locality sensitive hashing: MinHash and Super-Bit. Currently, the tool supports Java and Python submissions. Unlike its counterpart, [Comprehensive STRANGE](https://github.com/oscarkarnalim/CSTRANGE), SSTRANGE focuses on efficiency and it is suitable for large submissions. For comprehensive reporting, it is recommended to use [Comprehensive STRANGE or CSTRANGE](https://github.com/oscarkarnalim/CSTRANGE) instead.

**This is a work-in-progress and we are currently performing the evaluation. Use it at your own risk.**

## Acknowledgments
This tool uses [STRANGE](https://github.com/oscarkarnalim/strange) as the basis of development, [CSTRANGE](https://github.com/oscarkarnalim/strange) to develop user interface, [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) to tokenise given submissions, [tdebatty's module](https://github.com/tdebatty/java-LSH) to do locality sensitive hashing, [Google Prettify](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) to display source code, and [JSoup](https://jsoup.org/) to parse JPlag's HTML pages.
